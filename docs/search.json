The radio station is one of the best benefits of joining the club.\nRick Gilmore W3TM manages the station with the help of Mike Coslo N3LI, Eric Prescott W3EDP, and Woody Brem K3YV. Mark Wharton K0LO provides computer networking support.\nThis site provides information about how to gain access to the mountaintop station and how to use the equipment.\nThe mountaintop station has been a focal point of activity for the club. We operated Field Day 2023 and 2024 from the station, and we have held W3M special event operations, Pennsylvania QSO Party activities, and other contesting events.\nFor a PDF version of this guide, click here."

    "text": "Arrival procedures\nHere is the sequence we prefer all members use when accessing the mountaintop station.\n\nUnlock the yellow gate. Use the small key to unlock the padlock. The larger key opens the clubhouse itself. Take the padlock and locking bolt with you to the shack.\n\n\n\n\nHow to lock the gate\n\n\n\nClose the gate and replace the lock bar, but do not re-lock the gate.\nIf you know that others will be joining you soon, you may leave the gate open, but make sure to park cross-wise, blocking the past the shack. This ensures that no other driver can inadvertently drive past you and get locked behind the gate when you leave.\n\n\n\n\nNARC Clubhouse looking North\n\n\n\nUnlock door of the shack using the larger of the two keys. There is one lock above the door handle. Turn the key to the left (counterclockwise) to unlock the door.\nThere are light switches on the left just inside the door.\nPut the padlock and locking bar on the desk near the door.\nTurn up the heat, if needed.\n\nGo to the breaker box near the southeast corner of the shack (on your right as you enter the shack). By default, we leave breakers 7-14 – the baseboard and north wall 240 V heaters – off, and the remainder on. There is a label on the breaker panel to remind you.\nTurn breakers 7-14 on by pushing the breaker lever to the left to align with the others.\n\nThe porta potty key is on a hook to the right of the door. Note: The small key that opens the State Forest gate also opens the porta potty.\n\nThe toilet is serviced periodically. If it needs to be serviced, please let Rick W3TM know. The porta potty is on the South side of the shack.\n\nPlease text W3TM (814-777-3298), Eric W3EDP (814-867-3393), or Mike N3LI (814-404-3991) when you leave. Please report any issues that need to be addressed."

Feedlines from each radio hang on hooks below these antenna connectors. Choose the PL-259 connector with the yellow IC-7610 tag. Plug the cable from the radio into the cable connector for one of the antennas, for example, one of the triband Yagis for 10-20 m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMake sure that the antenna connection is snug, but not too snug that you can’t disconnect it later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDummy loads\n\n\n\nFor testing, you may connect the rig feedline to one of the two dummy loads located on the floor near the antenna connectors.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: High power 50 Ohm dummy loads located near the antenna connection panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2nd feedline\n\n\n\nAs of 2025-04-06 the IC-7610 has a second feedline that connects to the radio’s second VFO and receiver. The feedline uses green coax. It has a label tag indicating it connects to the IC-7610 sub receiver.\nThis feedline connects directly to the radio, so it only supports up to 100 W output power.\n\n\n\n\nPower up the Astron RS-35A power supply.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Astron RS-35A power supply\n\n\nAn Astron RS-35A powers the IC-7610/NARC1. The power supply is located next to the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier.\nThe unit is connected to a white Kasa smart outlet that allows remote shut-off of the radios. The smart outlet is plugged into a power strip under the wooden shelf, behind the PC, and adjacent to the radio. Touch the side of the smart switch to power-on the Astron RS-35A.\n\nYou should hear the Astron “kerchunk” and see the power switch illuminate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower up the IC-7610 radio.\n\nPress and briefly hold the power button highlighted in Figure 8.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: IC-7610 power switch\n\n\n\n\nPower up the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are not operating with more than 100 W or do not need the KPA1500’s built in antenna tuner, then leave the KPA1500 powered off.\n\n\nThe IC-7610/NARC1 is connected to the Elecraft KPA1500 amplifier. The power supply for the KPA1500 is under the desk on a small footstool. Check that the KPA1500 power supply is on. If necessary, power-up the power supply by hitting the power switch on the upper rear left side of the power supply. When the amplifier power switch is on, you will see 3 green lights: AC on, High V supply, Low V supply. Power up the KPA1500 by pressing the on switch on the lower right hand side of the KPA1500 front panel as shown in Figure 8.6.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: KPA1500 Power Switch\n\n\n\n\nLog-in to the computer\n\nPower up the PC by briefly pressing the power button on the right rear panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe PC can be a little slow to wake up.\n\n\n\nLog-in using the appropriate password\n\nThe IC-7610/NARC1 is connected via USB2 to the NARC1 PC.

    "text": "Amateur Contact Log\nAmateur Contact Log (AClog) by N3FJP is one of the logging packages installed on the NARC PCs.\nAmateur Contact Log has separate programs for general logging and specific contests like Field Day. The club has a license for the software, and this provides access codes for all of the logging programs.\n\nNetworked logging\nFor group contest-style events, it’s useful to have multiple rigs generate a single log file. This is called “networked logging”. Here is some resources useful for getting this to work for Field Day\nhttp://www.n3fjp.com/FDInfoTips.html\nThere are two types of networked logging, file share and TCP, we use TCP in almost all circumstances.\nFor Field Day 2024, we are using TCP. Here is a screenshot of the settings for NARC1:\n\n\n\nFigure 16.1: NARC1 N3FJP Field Day Log network settings\n\n\nIn this setup, NARC1 is the log server; NARC2 is a client.\n\n\n\nNARC2 N3FJP Field Day Log network settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points for networking N3FJP’s Field Day log via TCP\n\n\n\n\nFirst coded in July 2013, this option piggybacks on the functionality of the Status and Chat functions, to distribute adds, edits and deletes via TCP.\nAll PCs must enable the Status and Chat functions, which connect to the server on port 1000. If you have virus / Internet protection software, you must set your protection software on the server and EVERY client to allow this program to communicate on port 1000.\nDoes NOT require each client to navigate to the log file, so you don’t have to worry about file share permissions.\nThe server should host the file locally on its hard drive, not over the network, to eliminate any possibility of network file access delays. Choose your PC with the fastest processor and most RAM for the server.\nWhile loading the file may take longer via TCP, All Adds, Edits and Deletes should appear within one second on all clients.\nONLY the SERVER will and have the ability to perform many of the File menu options. This can be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on which functions you want the clients to be able to perform.\nIf your Network Status Display Form version reads 1.2 or later, in addition to the server, the TCP clients can also be set to write backups.\nAll PCs must select the same networking method. You can not mix and match! Either use File Share or TCP for every PC.\nWith the TCP method, more will be asked of the server, so processor timed sending of CW may be less precise.\n\n\n\n\n\nDigital mode logging\nTo configure select Settings/Application Program Interface (API) from the AC Log menus.\nINCLUDE_FIGURE_HERE\nAs THE FIGURE indicates, click on TCP API Enabled Server checkbox and use the default port (1100). Under WSTJ-X Interface select **Listen for WSJT-X*\n\nWSTJ-X\nIt’s best to use separate configurations for each use case. Here, we will describe our W3YA-FD (Field Day) configuration.\nUnder the WSJT-X File/Settings… menu there is a multi-tabbed window. Two windows are critical for Field Day logging with AC Log.\n\n\n\nFigure 16.2: NARC1 W3YA-FD Reporting Tab Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.3: NARC1 W3YA-FD Reporting Tab Settings\n\n\nWith these settings, WSJT-X controls the radio (and the associated COM port), while N3FJP periodically polls the WSTJ-X log and incorporates the data.\n\n\nFldigi\nNARC1 uses flrig for fldigi rig control. Here are some other settings relevant for Field Day logging.\n\n\n\nFigure 16.4: fldigi configuration under Configure/Contests\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.5: fldigi configuration under Configure/Logging/N3FJP Logs\n\n\nNOTE The figure does not have PTT via  and  checked, but I think it should be.\nAlso, please note that the “Connect” checkbox in the upper right is selected and the “Connected” indicator should be green.\n\n\nMore information\nHere are more resources for connecting N3FJP’s software to various digital mode programs:\nhttp://www.n3fjp.com/help/digitalsetup.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nStart the N3FJP logging program first, before the digital mode program.\nFrom N3FJP Software’s menu options click Settings &gt; Application Program Interface and check the upper check box that says TCP API Enabled (Server). Leave the lower check box unchecked.\nChoose whether N3FJP or the digital mode program will control the rig interface.\nFollow these steps for WSJT-X.\nFollow these steps for fldigi\nFollow these steps for GridTracker\nFollow these steps for JTAlert"
