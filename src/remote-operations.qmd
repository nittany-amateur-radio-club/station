title: "Remote operations"

## Overview

Since the winter of 2022-23, several club members have been experimenting with remote operations at the mountaintop.
The experiments have been conducted during the time of the year when lightning is not a meaningful risk, essentially December through February.

## Remote access to NARC-1

The steps are as follows:

1. Connect to the VPN.

2. Power up the radio via the Kasa app or the NARC Node Red server.

3. Connect to the radio

W3TM uses the [SDR-Control application](https://roskosch.de/sdr-control/).
It works on MacOS and iOS (both iPhone and iPad) and has an interface similar to the MacOS and iOS SmartSDR application for FlexRadios (see below).
The following screenshots depict SDR-Control operations from a Mac.

When the application opens, the following screen appears.

Clicking on the panel opens a window with available radios.

Clicking on the "NARC1-IC-7610" line connects to the radio.

### Shutting down

The steps to shut down are as follows:

1. Press the white "Disconnect" button in the upper panel.

2. Disconnect from the NARC VPN.

## Remote access to NARC2

There are two ways to access the NARC-2/Flex 6400M station.
One way involves use of the SmartSDR application to connect to the radio directly.
The other way involves accessing the NARC-2 PC and using the local copy of SmartSDR.

### Access directly via SmartSDR

The (paid) [MacOS](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-for-mac/) and [iOS](https://roskosch.de/smartsdr-features/) SmartSDR applications written by Marcus Roskosch and the (free) [Windows-only](https://www.flexradio.com/ssdr/ssdr-for-windows/) SmartSDR application provided by FlexRadio can be used to connect to the Flex 6400M using SmartLink.

The steps to access the Flex 6400M are as follows.

1. Connect to the VPN

2. Power up the radio via the NARC Node Red server (https://10.10.2.18:1880/ui).

The 'Flex Power' button powers up the Astron power supply. 'Flex On/Off' button powers up the radio.

3. Disconnect from the VPN

#### On iOS or MacOS SmartSDR

1. Open SmartSDR
