## Overview

NARC-3 is the HF station on the far (north) wall of the station.
It is located to the right of NARC-2, and immediately to the left of the [packet station](packet_aprs.qmd).

## Under construction

The NARC-3 station is no longer in service.

The club is likely to sell the [ICOM IC-718](ic-718.qmd) transceiver.

We are evaluating what to do with that station next.

It will likely become a place for members to bring their own rigs and connect them to our power supply, computer, and antenna systems.

Stay tuned!
