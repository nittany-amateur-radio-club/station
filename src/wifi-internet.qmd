## Background

Thanks to the work of Mark K0LO and Eric Brooks N3EB (SK), the clubhouse got internet service in the fall of 2020.

## Connecting to wifi

The wifi is for club members only.
The ssid is `NARC Members`.

Ask Mike N3LI, Rick W3TM, or Eric W3EDP for the password.

## Connecting to the internet via an Ethernet cable

The TP Link bridge/router has ethernet ports you may plug in to.

::: {.callout-note}

TODO: Add a photo of the bridge/router here.

TODO: We might also consider having some ethernet cables connected to the bridge/router.

:::

Note that NARC1, NARC2, and NARC3 use ports 1, 3, and 5. 
Please leave these connections alone.
The system runs a DHCP server, so you should be able to plug in your computer and acquire an IP address after a few moments.
