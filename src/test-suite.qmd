This chapter describes the suite of tests that we use to make sure that our stations remain in good operating condition.

## Monthly

W3TM tries and usually succeeds in running these steps on both NARC1 and NARC2 once a month.
The results of the tests are captured in a Google ~~doc~~ sheet located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4YUfq1UKwzU8MBJOeOxYSXyhnX518sDBoJ3o-CFqYc/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
Data from the Google sheet are imported when this page is updated.

### Power-up

- Connect rig to a suitable antenna or dummy load
- Power-up the Astron power supply
- Power-up the rig
- Log-on to the computer using the appropriate user name and password

### Phone operations

- Set power to 100 W or less
- Call CQ or answer a CQ
  - On the IC-7610, use Icom SM-30 desk mic with embedded push-to-talk (PTT) switch or the footswitch.
  - On the Flex 6400M, use the Yaesu mic or headset with the footswitch for PTT.

## Maintenance Log

This section downloads information about the latest maintenance activities.

::: {.callout-important}
These following sections are generated by the following steps:

1. Download a database (Google Sheet located [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4YUfq1UKwzU8MBJOeOxYSXyhnX518sDBoJ3o-CFqYc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) with the latest versions of the software packages installed on the NARC1 and NARC2 PCs. This is downloaded as a CSV.
2. Parsing the downloaded CSV data file in `include/csv/station-maintenance-log.csv`.
:::


### Set-up

The following code downloads the maintenance log file.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: download-narc-mountaintop-station-maintenance-log
#| include: false

if (!dir.exists('include/csv')) {
  message("Creating missing `include/csv/`.")
  dir.create("include/csv")
}

options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv("GMAIL_SURVEY"))
googledrive::drive_auth()

assertthat::is.string(params$google_log_fn)
assertthat::is.string(params$csv_log_fn)
save_path <- file.path("include", "csv", params$csv_log_fn)
assertthat::is.writeable(save_path)

googledrive::drive_download(
  params$google_log_fn,
  path = save_path,
  type = "csv",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

Then, we import the downloaded data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
log_entries <- readr::read_csv(save_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

### Recent tests

The most recent test activity occurred on `{r} max(log_entries$date)`.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-recent-test-results
#| tbl-cap: "Recent station test results"
latest_date <- max(log_entries$date)
log_entries |>
  dplyr::filter(date == latest_date) |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(date), equipment) |>
  dplyr::select(date, equipment, action) |>
  kableExtra::kable(format = 'html') |>
  kableExtra::kable_material()
```

## Contest/Field Day

### Test networked logging

- Rig1 in phone mode, log contact
- Rig2 in phone mode, log contact
- Change Rig1 band
- Change Rig2 band
- Change Rig1 to CW, log contact
- Change Rig2 to CW, log contact
- For each digital mode that will be used...
  - On Rig1, open digital app, attempt to make contact and log it
  - On Rig2, open digital app, attempt to make contact and log it
