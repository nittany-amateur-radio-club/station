## Summary

The Elecraft KPA1500 is a solid state 1500 W amplifier.

## Operating the KPA1500

### Confirm connections.

1. The amplifier should be connected via the ANT 1 input to an antenna. 
The feedlines hang from hooks near the North wall of the station and each has label indicating which radio station (NARC-1/IC-7610, NARC-2/Flex 6400M, or NARC-3/IC-718) the feedline services.

2. If the amplifier is connected to an antenna, you may power-up by pressing the button on the front of the amplifier.

3. Confirm that the antenna input selector is set to ANT 1.

4. The amplifier should be connected to the IC-7610 or Flex 6400M via a short coax patch cable. 
The default configuration is from the amplifier to the transceiver's ANT 1 port.
  
### Ensure that antenna tuner is in-line

NARC offers a variety of resonant antennas for your use, but it is prudent to use the automatic antenna tuner that the KPA1500 provides.

On the KPA1500 front panel, press the ATU TUNE/ATU MODE button to select the ATU IN mode (green light).

### Determine the band and power needs for your mode of operation

#### < 100 W operation

Most digital modes (FT8/FT4, JS8Call, fldigi) are also conventionally low power (< 100 W) modes. 
For these modes, you will want to operate the amplifier in standby (STBY) mode, but with the antenna tuner in-line.

#### > 100 W operation

For modes where power > 100 W is desired (e.g., phone, CW, RTTY), you will need to tune-up the amplifier.
